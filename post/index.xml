      <description> Buy the book The book is for sale in all Amazon shops with a size that can be easily carried in your back pocket. And it&amp;rsquo;s cheaper than a dish of paella in one of the tourist traps in the city center which the book helps you avoid, so it will save you money.

      <description>Granada On, the book This book is about Granada, a living city that exists before, during and after the Alhambra, the paella and the shopping. It is about the graffiti, about the technology, about urban exploration and about stuff that is in plain sight and yet almost never seen.
It is about a city to be lived and walked and eaten and drunk. A city that has to be discovered over and over again.</description>
